Titile: Dynamics of a Covid-19 Outbreak Model with Hospitalized and Home-care Patients Groups

Description:
A mathematical model of Covid-19 dynamics considering Hospitalized and Home-care Patients Groups. We used differential equations to describe the spread of the disease in the population. The dynamic of the disease is managed by ODE using rk4 method. The model is compartmental one, it has 7 compartments.

Run our GAMA source code:
To run these source codes, download GAMAPLATFORM 1.9 url: https://gama-platform.github.io/download for free. Please be sure that you have JDK or JRE installed in your system. Create a new model and copy/paste the model (Covid.gaml) to your GAMA, file: Covid.gaml.

Run our python and R source code :
Identify all .r and .py file and execute them, please edit data (.csv or xls files) location.

Enjoy
